          Many people aim to become a graduate but not everyone has the chance to experience the university life, especially for a child from a below average family. It’s not an easy path. And the financial limitations, also makes life stressful for those who aspire to do something remarkable in their lives. In this book, the writers have shared all those difficulties which life brought to them from their school days to graduation and afterwards. But those difficulties transformed them into more matured persons and they faced each challenge with utmost strength and self motivation. 
This book/memoir is written by Shathees Bhaskaran, a faculty member at Azman Hashim International Business school, universiti Teknologi Malaysia, Kuala lumpur, along with his university colleagues Jasveena R. Prabhagaran and Nomahaza Mahadi.  They aspire to inspire people through their writings with a hope to make a difference in the lives of people.
Being a fresh graduate is a curse or blessing? The bitter reality which is still prevailing today is    “ nobody taught us how to cope with life when it turns out unfair. Nobody told us education is a lifelong journey with very less educational and job opportunities. Authors in this book, claim that students spend their university days and years with no any clear goals and planning for the future. 
It seems to them as if after graduation the recruiters would be waiting for them to offer them jobs. But the things might not be this much easier. 
The book is comprised of 5 chapters. Each chapter is full of some regrets, disappointments and worrisome that were felt by the writers while in search of job. Searching for job vacancies on LinkedIn, tv and newspapers, applying for jobs and sometimes applying for jobs not even related to the field of interest, just to overcome the curse of being called a jobless. Moreover, Keeping an eye on the email notifications from the companies became a routine work and getting rejected from the companies after attending several interviews, were some of the real challenges which made them physically as well as mentally numb and exhausted. 
A graduate scout everywhere for an opportunity; on LinkedIn, google, magazines even he/she goes door to door just to get a chance to prove themselves that they are neither undisciplined nor lazy upon completion of their first degree. But Irony of fate is that after all the efforts put in, they receive punishments from everyone in the form of stress, discrimination and denial. It means ONE IS PUNISHED FOR BEING A FRESH GRADUATE! Regrettably, at the end of the day, all a fresh graduate has is disappointment. But they regain hope every next day thinking that such experiences will make them able to determine whether he/she is brave enough to take risks while carrying out the action and whether he/she is a solution seeker or problem solver.
